### What I learned

During this project the major challenge was to do a responsive design. 
I used flexbox and try to use viewheight and rem instead of pixels. 
I had some difficulties to align the text with the image of the QR. At the end, to get the text to break at the same words
that the example I end up using '<br>'. I think there is a better way of doing it with the margins of the 'title' and 'description' divs but I wasnÂ´t able to do it.
The last challenge was setting the footer and the bottom center of the page in all different media querys wich I'm really 
proud of myself.

``
.attribution { 
    position: fixed;
    left: 50%;
    bottom: 20px;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    margin: 0 auto;
    font-size: 0.8rem; 
    text-align:center; 
    
}
``
### Continued development

In future projects I want to focus on doing a mobile first design and getting more comfortable in using flexbox.
